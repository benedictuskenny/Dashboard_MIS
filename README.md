# Dashboard_MIS
East Java is one of the largest provinces in Indonesia. The tourism sector is the largest revenue contributor. Therefore, the tourism sector must be managed properly. In East Java, the Dinas Pariwisata is an institution that manages data related to the tourism sector. Starting from visitors, and accommodation businesses to gross regional domestic product.

The development of information and communication technology has a positive impact on the management of activities related to data and information systems. This became the reason for the creation of the East Java Indonesia tourism dashboard using R-shiny.

This dashboard shows tourism information such as tourists, travelers, accommodation businesses, star and non-star hotels, lodging, average daily guests, and GRDP (Gross Regional Domestic Product). We expect to help users easier to get to know more about tourism in East Java. In addition, it is also expected to be able to optimize the management of tourism resources and shorten the processing time of data management at the Dinas Pariwisata Jawa Timur.

This dashboard is divided into seven sidebars:
1. Introduction – Knowing the background, purpose, and benefits of creating a dashboard
2. Dataset – Knowing the dataset used and descriptive statistics
3. Regency/City Profile – Knowing the state of the Regency/City in East Java
4. Accommodation – Knowing the accommodation growth, total accommodation, accommodation comparisons, and the correlation of several variables in the dashboard
5. Travel – Knowing the development of travel agents and agencies, the percentage of hotel room usage by tourists, and the average length of stay of tourists in East Java
6. Cluster – Regency/City classification based on several variables related to tourism using the KMeans method
7. Author – Author Dashboard
